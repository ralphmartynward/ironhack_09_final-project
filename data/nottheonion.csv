Wrong. First post I responded to said anti fascists were the ones using violence. He said nothing of the actual ""fascists"" using violence. 

It's ironic because that's a key characteristic in just about every definition of fascism. Nobody had actually pointed to any fascist behavior by the right, only the violence by the left. 

>Which is ridiculous. You want a definition of fascism? It’s notoriously hard to pin down but most political theorists agree that it is a totalitarian state that is anti-worker, usually pro-business, and culturally right wing. Anti-fascist ideology is literally the opposite of that.

Could you be more vague with your answer please?

Anti worker? You mean anti individual, right? Fascists historically had a very regulated economy with conscripted non military work. That's not a free market at all, and is certainly not ""pro business"" but rather ""pro nation."" ""Culturally right wing?"" What does that even mean?

Sorry to pick on you but I've seen this a lot in this thread, this is absolutely terrible reasoning. People develop at different rates but many 10 year olds literally aren't capable of understanding long term consequences. The tragedy here is that a deeply troubled child had access to a loaded gun.

This screams emotional/mental instability and a lack of impulse control, not some hannibal style 10 year old that wants to reap souls. 

If he has an undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder (this seems super likely) and was able to access a loaded firearm, I find it incredibly difficult to blame the kid for this. I doubt even now he's really truly understood the ramifications of what he's done.


10 is so incredibly young, while the consequences are tragic and something must be done, we can't seriously think that a 10 year old is beyond helping, regardless of what they've done. Some 10 year olds still have imaginary friends ffs!",2022-12-17 05:15:25

As long as you personally attend to and guard all the other kids who are in prison after being tried as adults.

He should be in a mental rehab center.

>This kid is a pyschopath. If you want to take him in, go for it. Look up pyschopathic murderers and their odds of recidivism before making stupid comments.

This kid has obvious mental health issues. There are many, many mental health disorders that can manifest in extremely violent behaviors that are very treatable. Either way though, we cannot justly treat somebody as an adult with never having afforded them the rights of an adult.

>Im sure in your fairy tale world things are better and more optimistic. Unfortunately life doesn't work that way, princess.

Ideally my world would have extremely large reforms to our criminal justice system. It's currently about revenge over justice and punishment over prevention. Corruption related to privatization of related industries is rampant, and there are many times when a lawyer should be required to be present when they aren't.

>No one here is vengeful and wants to see this kid punished.

Yo are you blind? Try reading the thread.

>It's a tragic story and there is no happy ending for this kid.

No kidding, he likely actually did love his mother, despite having killed her. Even if he gets better, he'll always have to live with that.

>Before you go online and act all ""holier than thou"" maybe spend an hour researching why these rules and laws exist.

I have read a lot about this kind of shit. My favorite case was a prosecutor attempting to charge a kid as an adult for distribution of child pornography for sexting his girlfriend. Setting aside the obvious issue that they were his pictures of his own body that he sent willingly to a party he was intimate with, how do you charge somebody as an adult when the nature of their crimes requires they they are a child?

Long story short, these laws and practices are inane and serve only for the purpose of revenge. If the people in power actually cared about prevention of harm they'd invest in the youth beforehand and make treatment available as an option, but they instead opt to throw them in prison to make it appear like they're trying to do something. Barbarism and hypocrisy.

>A 10 year old that murders like this, does not get better.

Bold assertion Doctor.

>No one is happy about this case. We just don't live in a delusional fantasy like you. The real world can be bleak. Sorry to burst your ignorant bubble

Comment,1,j0jjudw,,0,1671246165.0,"So there are three factors to consider here.

Factor 1: he definitely ""knew"" what he was doing when he shot her. 

Factor 2: he could likely have some serious mental issues.

Factor 3: his age.

To not be tried as an adult, his lawyer is going to have to convince a judge at least 2 out of these 3 factors are valid excuses for his behaviour. 

There is no question about the first. The reason this case isn't a slam dunk is because of the second and third factors, and it is also the reason why the whole try as a minor vs adult thing is even a consideration. Factors 2 and 3 are most likely going to determine how severely the kid will be punished, though. They don't, in any way, diminish the severity of his crime. 

Factor 3, ie. his age, isn't necessarily a mitigating factor here because it would be very easy to prove most ten year olds have some understanding about it being morally wrong to murder their mother just to buy a video game. They may not be able to articulate the philosophical argument for this topic very well, but ask any random ten year old and they will almost all say killing is wrong and/or that killing for ""profit"" is wrong. So given the severity of the crime and the fact it wasn't an accidental killing, arguing that he is too young to know what he was doing will be difficult. Not impossible, mind you, but very difficult. 

Factor 2 is up in the air. None of us here have the wherewithal to diagnose what's wrong with this kid, how severe his condition is, and so on. I can't really say or have an opinion on this beyond that it is most likely going to be the main determinator on how this case moves forward.",2022-12-17 05:02:45

You don't even know what you're talking about, obviously just throwing darts. No, she was not included in a will he made. We could not evict her, we tried what we could.

What the fuck does ""essentially murdered"" mean?

>who me and my pregnant girlfriend had to move in with at the time because the cops protected her for whatever reason while I was grieving and was trying to raise a family of my own

So you chose to live with you fathers ""murderer"" and somehow that's the polices fault? Becuase you chose to impregnate a woman when you can't even provide yourself with housing? Sounds your dad's girlfriend was generous to let you still live with her after your dad's death.


>So yeah, I have already been in that situation before, having to support a murderer in my childhood home

No, let's be clear here. You were supported in your childhood home by your father and his girlfriend. Becuase you chose to impregnate someone while completely incapable of taking care of yourself, your gf, or a child. That's inherently selfish and you should be ashamed of yourself for that alone. When your father died, unless the girlfriend was in the will, you could've easily evicted her. As his house would become yours after his death. You're obviously lying or leaving out a lot of detail.

>But none of this matters to you probably. It's all imaginary internet points to most people on here

None of this matters to people here, becuase your story is total bullshit. Unless your dad willed the house to his girlfriend, you could've evicted her (assuming she did not inherit the house according to his will).

Comment,6,j0jedyv,,0,1671243396.0,"I'd recommend reading about a case before using it as an example to lambast society.

“According to the complaint, the boy initially told police he was twirling the gun around his finger when it “accidentally went off.” In a second police interview, he revised his story of what happened the morning of Nov. 21. He said that the night before, he had taken his mother’s keys — including the key to the gun’s lock box. In the morning, he had retrieved her his mother’s gun because he was angry that she’d woken him up at 6:00, when he usually sleeps until 6:30. He also told police she had not allowed him to get something he wanted off of Amazon. He went to the basement, where she was doing laundry, he said, and had taken up a shooting stance, pointing the gun at her with both hands. He closed his left eye and fired. He said he’d intended to shoot at the wall to “scare her,” but that she’d walked in front of him and he’d shot her in the face from about three feet away. 

Family members said the boy was intelligent and manipulative, and said no relative would agree to babysit him. The boy’s sister said he’d had “rage issues” his entire life. When he was four, his his mother’s sister said, he picked up his puppy by the tail and swung it around until it howled in pain. His mother eventually gave the dog away. Six months before the shooting, his sister said, he had filled a balloon with flammable liquid and set it on fire, causing an explosion that burned furniture in the house. She told police that when her mom asked the boy why he did it, he claimed “he has five different imaginary people that talk to him…two weeks before the shooting, she told the boy’s sister someone had unplugged the cameras.

The morning after the shooting, the boy logged onto his dead mother’s Amazon account and ordered an Oculus Virtual Reality Headset. The aunt said that when he saw his grandmother crying later that day, he said, “I’m really sorry for what happened. I’m sorry for killing my mom,” then asked if his Amazon package had arrived.”

Irrelevant. Their laws aren't really all that restrictive and are considered some of the most liberal on the planet(the actual definition of liberal, not the bootlickers in the US). 

Other than machine guns a background check, a shall issue permit, and a reason of sport shooting is enough to buy just about anything else.

And even in the US machine guns are a pain in the ass to get unless you have significant wealth.

The biggest difference is getting a CCW, which is a can of worms that is completely irrelevant to ASSault rifles, which is what im specifically talking about.

Well yea, if people weren't so Gung ho about taking peoples' guns our culture would likely be very different.

In short, trying to help him is almost certainly wasted effort at best, and is likely to result in additional suffering and/or death when he gets a chance to reoffend.

They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck.

Comment,1,j0janfv,,0,1671241524.0,"Are we still doing this? Every couple of weeks a new ""overdose"" that manifest as a panic attack  is reported by police and then the magic positive opioid results never manifest. Fentanyl is a drug that exists outside of misuse and abuse and we have a lot of well established information regarding both its use and the use of drugs like it. It irritates me to no end that these people are points of contacts with at risk communities and can't even accurately identify an opioid overdose? What training exactly is happening in law enforcement facilities? I could train a group of elementary aged kids the difference in two minutes. There appears to be an anxiety problem within law enforcement officers regarding opioids so maybe the time has come to decriminalize since the cops can't even look at drugs without needing a fucking benzo (yes the treatment for this bullshit is literally to take a CNS depressant the fucking irony).

Comment,1,j0j94f6,,0,1671240766.0,"While I agree with you that a child is a child and that there is the potential to course correct with proper help, I think the question is more or less ""what happens if it doesn't work?"" 

Everyone knows that the ""proper monitoring and help"" isn't always readily available, and won't always be effective. If he were trialed as a minor, and rehabilitation turns out poorly (whether do to himself or slipping through the system's cracks), what do you do? Let him go until he commits another act (and pray he doesn't) or keep him locked up for something he did as a child?

Ideally, this would all be pointless worrying, and the kid will respond well to treatment and atone for it. But given the details of the act and his childhood, is it a risk worth taking? Is his potential chance to atone his grievous crime and change worth potentially putting others at risk down the line? Or is better to play it safe and lock him up, not knowing whether he could have been fixed or not (and thus setting a precedent that may take away chances from children who *could* have been saved.)

Damned if you do, damned if you don't. I'm not nearly well-versed enough in this type of situation to give a definitive answer; I just know that this is a very complex situation where the judge has to weigh a lot of different values. It is a difficult choice.",2022-12-17 03:32:46

On my 30th a whole bunch of us hired out the uni tavern and we shared about 500 mushrooms around a group of about 30 of us. I distinctly remember going back to my parents house (I was a student so I was living back at the folks), tearing up my bedroom smashing furniturer and shouting ""MUM WHERES MY MUSHROOMS"" and then leaving again back to the party.

Come end of the night I was so freaked out about the prospect of going home knowing I would be in massive trouble for being a drug fueled psycho. I walk in. Mum says ""Oh hi!"" , I mumble something incomprehensible and go to my room and..... its fine , no broken furniture, no disorder, nothing.

Next day I ask mum if I was weird when had come back, and mum said I had just briefly come in looking a bit drunk looking and mumbling about ""Fuzzy logic"" and ""Big gorilla hands"" , grabbed a jacked and left again.  She said I was polite if a little confusing.

The whole screaming shouting furniture smashing thing never happened. But I remember it as sharply as if it where. Not like ""remembered a dream vividly"" but ""remembered a thing that happened"".",2022-12-17 03:13:56

And what’s with the random comment on school shooting, what does it have to do with the article at hand? Should we also point out how 31% of 10 years old male from India grow up to become physically or sexually violent towards their spouse? Is that also in the discussion about “kids today”?

Comment,1,j0j4p2j,,0,1671238569.0,"Can fentanyl be absorbed through the skin or by touching an item or surface where it is present?


It is a common misconception that fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, but it is not true for casual exposure. You can't overdose on fentanyl by touching a doorknob or dollar bill. The one case in which fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin is with a special doctor-prescribed fentanyl skin patch, and even then, it takes hours of exposure.

I'm not sure whether a psychopath would have psychosis. A psychopath has no empathy or care for anything, and was born without it.

My mom, bipolar 2, had psychosis. Heard voices and occasionally saw things. Delusions and hallucinations. It's very frightening or upsetting for most people who have this.

I don't know if a psychopath would feel any of those.

Supposedly, the puppy torture occurred when he was four.

I'm trying to imagine when I was four. Would I have been smart enough to understand that I was a puppy's caretaker? Obviously most children wouldn't harm a pet due to empathy, but this kid likely lacks empathy. Maybe the sort of intervention you describe (assigned animals) also has a minimum age where it's effective, where children need to be old enough to comprehend that the animal is theirs to care for?

Therapy shifts the needle on kids who have a disconnect between right and wrong, but no compulsions or other mental illnesses to harm others. The kid who manipulates those around him to receive accolades and prizes can be convinced to do good/neutral things in order to avoid consequences like ""jail"" and ""exorbitant fines."" These people can become everything from politicians and doctors to drifters who grift to get by. I suspect the outcome depends upon how motivated and/or privileged the individual is during their formative years. 

The kid who tortures animals, lights things on fire, hears voices, and kills his family by the age of **ten** is not coming back. I don't care if you put him in the Vatican and make him listen to every sermon on peace, love, and God the Pope can put together. That boy is not recovering. There's something physically wrong in his brain, and we have neither the drugs nor surgical techniques to correct it. In the 1400's he would be sent into the army, join a gang of bandits, or poison his elder brother to inherit the family title. In the modern era, we lock them up and try to stop them from doing harm. That's the best plan anyone has come up with. 

If you want to fix it, be my guest. Go get degrees in psychology, psychiatry, criminal justice, etc. Do research. Change the world. I don't personally think this is worth pursuing, but I also don't give a damn what you choose to do with your life *provided* you don't hurt people. Studying individuals with ASPD and trying to cure them might be futile, but that doesn't mean you can't give it a go. It means you need to be prepared to fail.",2022-12-17 02:33:53

This is more analogous to teaching a salmon to enjoy Pink Floyd than it is swimming up a mountain. If the capacity to feel empathy isn't there it isn't there. Empathy is an incentive. It's something people feel viscerally. Crucially, sociopaths (people who lack empathy) can still *understand the concept of empathy* even though they don't experience it. So it's not a matter of training someone to understand, rationally, why they *should* feel empathy.  They already understand the logic (probably even at 8 years old honestly).

Honestly - based on the Rolling Stone article - outpatient treatment wasn't working and the kid was an active danger to society.

I doubt he is going to improve much simply for turning 18.

It's probably safer for everyone, including him, for him to be incarcerated for a very very long time, if not for life.

His actions, as reported, were deliberate and pre-meditated. The fact that he lied on the first response shows that he knew what he did was wrong.

Disabling the cameras and stealing the gun ahead of time and then lying about intent demonstrates he understood the consequences and had malicious intent - I'd have said he has shown that capacity to think and act like an adult - plenty of adults commit crimes with less forethought and planning and comprehension that what they're doing is wrong.",2022-12-17 02:25:43

Most children did not express shame, whether due to unique brain chemistry or not, yet they still felt unwilling to let their guard down even at age 8. The program gave them freedom to exist. It was a controlled environment but not oppressive. No one would hurt them. No one rebuked them. No one told them they couldn't fixed.

(All programs have their limitations of course; understaffing is another issue)

Sociopathy and psychopathy can be observed in PET scans, however that does not necessitate criminal behavior. Low or nil responses to stress triggers are not a death knell to having a relatively normal life.

Some children will be in and out of psychiatric programs for the rest of their lives. Some will recidivate, many will be effectively abandoned by families, and some will go on to function as normally as possible.

They reach for something easy and effective eg they might reach for an object that’s close by and launch it. It hits. It has a direct affect with next to no effort but the initial rage has been dealt with (to them). 
Now guns have the same effect. I presume this kid didn’t “load up a gun and cock it too” as I’d presume that he wouldn’t be able to given his age. He’s reached for something to express his rage and it so happens that’s it’s blown his mother face off.  It’s not his fault it was close by.

There was no dude, kid or truck. My legs weighed about 1000 lbs each and I couldn't walk without clomping around. Slept in my car cause I couldn't figure out how to get in the tent. Later that evening one of my buddies came and knocked on my window to let me know he was gonna bounce. Decided to follow, so I started the car, put it in gear, and the car died. Reached up to start the car again and the keys weren't even in the ignition. Repeat about 4 or 5 times til I ACTUALLY got the car started, at which point said friend came running up to my window (from the tent that he had been sound asleep in) to ask me WTF I was doing. It was then that I realized that had I figured out how to make the car go, I would have driven off a cliff. Waited til morning to actually leave. An imaginary owl escorted me the entire way home occasionally asking me WHO? I didn't have an answer for him lol.

Comment,2,j0ixlft,,0,1671235158.0,"Compared to a classic hallucinogen, deliriants produce their subjective effects via entirely different biochemical pathways.

Hallucinogens like LSD usually activate various subtypes of serotonin receptors, whereas deliriants like datura and scopolamine are acetylcholine inhibitors, which is a completely different neurotransmitter to serotonin.

This causes significant negative physical effects, namely delirium as the name suggests, which is otherwise known as an acute confusional state. There is often marked agitation, blunting of thought processes and dysphoria (a state of intense unease, the opposite of euphoria). The high is often reported as inherently negative with marked realistic visual hallucinations that are often sinister in nature. Full blown drug-induced psychosis is much more common with these drugs and they are rather dangerous.

I have plenty of experience with psychedelics but deliriants are not something I have much interest in trying, can't imagine that the juice is worth the squeeze..",2022-12-17 01:59:18

I wrote a report about how the first time I smoked a cigarette, I fainted, falling face-forward.  And how if I had been driving at the time, I would have crashed the car.  This is not an uncommon experience - the same thing is happening to teens today with nicotine vapes.  One girl ended up in the hospital because she fainted and hit her head from the nicotine.  

But there is no warning on the packs, no schools teach children, that you should absolutely not be operating heavy machinery if you are new to nicotine.  Nobody warned us about this at all!  They said it'll give you cancer and it's addictive, they never said ""oh yeah and it can make you collapse if it's your first time"".  That's dangerous!

Several children had histories of abusing animals and insects, however none were assigned animals immediately or left unsupervised.

As far as I read, the boy's family were highly unwilling to take him in or even contact him. They refuse to pay bail.

He will likely enter a juvenile psychiatric program. If he achieves rehabilitation, one sign would be despairing over the fact he killed his mother. Murderers cannot escape this. The best we can hope is that he grows into a functioning adult who can live with remorse without returning to the behaviors that caused it.

Mostly just a nerdy kid and I never really got to know him too well personally, but we hung out in groups a fair bit. Few years later he was into steroids and coke and I guess he needed money because he owed a coke dealer who fronted him stuff to sell, and he just did it all himself. Then he found out his mom had money, and killed her in a rage, tried to make it look like suicide, and failed miserably; I was there when the case was being described in court.
